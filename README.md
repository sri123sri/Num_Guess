# Number Guessing Game in Java

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game project! This Java program allows users to play a simple number guessing game, where they have to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/sri123sri/Num_Guess.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Num_Guess

3. Compile the Java source file:
javac Num_Guess.java

4. Run the game:
java Num_Guess
5. The program will prompt you to enter the range for the random number (e.g., 1 to 100). After setting the range, the game will generate a random number, and you will be asked to guess it.

6. Enter your guess and press Enter. The program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number!

7. Once you guess the number, the game will display the number of attempts it took to win, and you can choose to play again or exit the game.
